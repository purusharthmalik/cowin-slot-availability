# Cowin-slot-availability

A python script that you can keep running in the background to get instantly notified whenever a slot opens up in your district.

Once executed, the script will check the cowin API for slots in your district every 60 seconds.

The cowin API will only function on Indian IP addresses, so you may have to disable your VPN.
